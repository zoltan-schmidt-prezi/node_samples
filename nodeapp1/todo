TODO

SOLVE CALCULATION IN THE BACKEND!!!
RETURN ONLY A JSON OBJECT FROM THE HTTP REQUEST
proper variable and function names
fix hardcoded chart number (5)
put charts on one page eventually?
third page can be tabular data

add historic data
add date selector
draw baselines instead of portfolios on exchange rate charts

fix date in moment
add authentication
cors, sql injection

DONE

separate common functions and page functions
FIX calculaiton on full portf
second page could be sum of portfolios
 -> stack bond portfolios?
separate chart and table for portfolios on portf page > too big diff in size to small in value change
- render triggering is a mess
add own data
- only one dataset per bond
turn into proper service
- mouseover glitches, probably rendering issue
consolidate routes> list, mysqlrates
