add buydates for baseline on rate page
PUT all portfolios on one page > no selector needed
fix date in moment

tabular historic data for collections (per collection?)

SOLVE CALCULATION IN THE BACKEND!!!
RETURN ONLY A JSON OBJECT FROM THE HTTP REQUEST
proper variable and function names
fix hardcoded chart number (5)

add authentication
cors, sql injection

DONE

NOT NEEDED set default selection for dropdown
trigger refresh after date selection (events?)
draw baselines on exchange rate charts
!!!!add date selector
add historic data
add basline for portfolios
separate common functions and page functions
FIX calculaiton on full portf
second page could be sum of portfolios
 -> stack bond portfolios?
separate chart and table for portfolios on portf page > too big diff in size to small in value change
- render triggering is a mess
add own data
- only one dataset per bond
turn into proper service
- mouseover glitches, probably rendering issue
consolidate routes> list, mysqlrates
