DONE

add historic data
add basline for portfolios
separate common functions and page functions
FIX calculaiton on full portf
second page could be sum of portfolios
 -> stack bond portfolios?
separate chart and table for portfolios on portf page > too big diff in size to small in value change
- render triggering is a mess
add own data
- only one dataset per bond
turn into proper service
- mouseover glitches, probably rendering issue
consolidate routes> list, mysqlrates
